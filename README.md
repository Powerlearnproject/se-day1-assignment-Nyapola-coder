Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing deployment and maintenance. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects in the mordern life, incuding communication, commerce,entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of programming langauge (eg, Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advert of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementations- Writing code and building the software according to the design specification 
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements 
Deployment- Release of the software to users or customers 
Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology involves the sequential approach with distinct phases eg requirements, design, implementation etc. An exampleo of a scenario which would be appropriate under the methodolgy include predictable projects where the requirements are fully defined, stable and unlikely to change significantly through out the development process. Whereas Agile methodologies involve the Iterative and increamental approach focused on the flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. a good case scenario is the complex large projects that require flexibilty and adaptabilty

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- Responsible for writing code and implementations of software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer- Ensures software quality by designung and executing test plans
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. They include Visual studios, Eclipse among others. On the other hand, Version Control Systems (VCS) are useful for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. They include; Git, Subversion among others.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delayes. This can be overcomed by continous learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies, frameworks and programming langauges through online courses, conferences and self-studies
Technical debt- accrued from shortcuts resulting from poor coding practises or rushed developments which could lead to increased maintainance cost and hinder future development. This can be solved by prioritizing technical debt and allocation to address it proactively. Refactor code regularly to improve mainatanabilty and reduce future costs

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Testing of individual components or modules of software
Intergration testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing- Testing the entire software a a whole 
 Acceptance testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It is important in that it aids in the generation of quality responses from the AI model that suits the needs of the user

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague promot is " Translate the following text" instead of "Translate the following English text to Swahili while providing a formal but friendly tone. Make it a short precise one and compress it to a one paragraph".
